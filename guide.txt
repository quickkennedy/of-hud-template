import your hud

first, rename your huds clientscheme (resource/clientscheme.res) to "clientscheme-[something].res". replace [something] with anything you want, just remember it for later.

second, rename your huds hudlayout (scripts/hudlayout.res) to "hudlayout-[something].res". replace [something] with anything you want, just remember it for later.

third, rename your huds scoreboard (resource/ui/scoreboard.res) to "scoreboard-[something].res". replace [something] with anything you want, just remember it for later.

then, import the template files. make sure to override any files that need to be overwritten.

go into the NEW clientscheme, hudlayout, and scoreboard files and replace the text "void" with whatever you did in place of [something] earlier.

now, start up open fortress. load into any map, preferably dm_dev_itemtest.

if you see a "%metal%" on your screen once loaded in, go into resource/ui/huddamageaccount.res and delete every element that isnt "CDamageAccountPanel"

next, go into resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res and delete everything below "PlayerStatusAnchor".

your hud should now work in open fortress.
