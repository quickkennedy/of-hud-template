import your hud

first, rename your huds clientscheme (resource/clientscheme.res) to "clientscheme-[something].res". replace [something] with anything you want, just remember it for later.

second, rename your huds hudlayout (scripts/hudlayout.res) to "hudlayout-[something].res". replace [something] with anything you want, just remember it for later.

third, rename your huds scoreboard (resource/ui/scoreboard.res) to "scoreboard-[something].res". replace [something] with anything you want, just remember it for later.

then, import the template files. make sure to override any files that need to be overwritten.

go into the NEW clientscheme, hudlayout, and scoreboard files and replace the text "void" with whatever you did in place of [something] earlier.

now, start up open fortress. load into any map, preferably dm_dev_itemtest.

if you see a "%metal%" on your screen once loaded in, go into resource/ui/huddamageaccount.res and delete every element that isnt "CDamageAccountPanel"

next, go into resource/ui/hudplayerhealth.res and delete everything below "PlayerStatusAnchor".

next, go into scripts/hudlayout-[something].res and delete all of the element "HudWeaponSelection"

your hud should now work in open fortress, however a few more things will be needed for it to be 100% perfect.

the following files will need to be edited to look like your normal hud. this CANNOT be done automatically, and you will have to be a bit of an artist and imagine what the creator would have done:

- resource/ui/hudlungemeter.res
this file is the meter used by the grappling hook shotgun
- resource/ui/hudlightningcharge.res
this file is the meter used by the lightning gun
- resource/ui/scoreboarddm.res
this file is the scoreboard used in deathmatch
- resource/ui/dmteammenu.res
this file is the team selection menu used in deathmatch
- resource/ui/basemodui/mainmenu.res
this file is the entire main menu. it has different buttons than those found in live tf2, and as such needs to be changed.

you can check in on the sourcemod hud development discord server for information on how to do these things: https://discord.gg/QKsBkdqxbN
